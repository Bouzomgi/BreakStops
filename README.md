# BreakStops
IMPORTANT: I've included an original version and an updated version of this code. The original was written in Fall of 2018 (after my first CMPSC class) and the second is a modernized version which was greatly uphauled using advanced techniques which I wrote in Fall of 2019, a full year later. I thought it would be cool to upload proof of my ability to improve.

Also, I've redacted my Google API key for privacy.

BreakStops uses OOP (in the form of Schedule and HourMin classes) and the Google Distance Matrix API.
BreakStops is a project I came up with and created completely independently in a Hackathon my Fall Semester of my Sophmore year. This is a product of a single computer science class (CMSC132: Python 1) and was my pride and joy for a good while. 

The premise of the script is to take in a schedule and inform you about what you can do between your classes while factoring in walking distances between them.
The script intelligently scans key location's proximity to your classes and informs you on a timely choice of where to visit during your break.

I've always struggled to determine how long walks on my campus realistically take, and because Penn State is so massive, my problem is only exasturbated. I also despise being late. These two issues make me severely undershoot how much time I typically have to spend between classes, and I'm usually either wasting time worrying, or sitting in the seat of a lecture that won't start for another half hour. BreakStops was build as a solution for this issue.
